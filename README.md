qml-remoteobjects
=================

qml-remoteobjects WOULD hopefully contain QML wrappers for Qt's Remote Objects module objects. For now, it doesn't work
as Remote Objects is not yet ready for production due to random segfaults, non-polymorphic behavior and missing
documentation for dynamic remoting.
